  title: "Who are we?"
  content: '<p class="lead">
    We are a group of neuroscience researchers interested in understanding the role of learning in chronic pain development.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    Pain teaches us how to protect our body. Although this is beneficial in normal circumstances, an "overactive" pain system could amplify pain beyond what is necessary. Indeed, it has been proposed that learning processes gone wrong are central to the transition to, or maintenance of, chronic pain. 
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    You can help us understand how pain changes the learning process by tracking your thinking and movement using our online tools.
